# Robot_Arm_Automation

This project is rebuild an old LabVolt Automation Robotic Arm with new hardware and software components. 

Modes of control: Manual, Mimic, Automated, Voice  

**Manual Mode**
Here there is a control box that has game controller hand wheels that can be used to accuate the Robotic Arm.

**Mimic Mode -- IN PROGRESS**
Here the integrated Camera will track a users hand motion and move the Robotic Arm accordingly.  

**Automated Mode -- IN PROGRESS**
Here an App or computer will be able to program a series of positoins that the Robotic Arm should follow.  
This will be used to automate tasks. The program will be an a intutive UI that outputs Gcode which can be read with any CNC controller.

**Voice Mode -- IN PROGRESS**
Here we will use a system like Alexa to listen for commands and move the Robotic Arm accordingly.
